This repository contains all the code for the Battlecode Python engine.

## How to Run

```
$ python3 main.py
```

This will run the example bot in `examplefuncsplayer`. Try modifying `examplefuncsplayer/bot.py` and see that it works. Also note how the amount of remaining bytecode decreases as you add more instructions, which is exactly what we want!
